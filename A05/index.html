        <h5 class="section-title text-center">Historical Significance</h5>
        <p>
          Jeonju’s origins trace back to the Three Kingdoms period (c. 57 BCE–668 CE),
          serving as a strategic center for civil and military administration. During the
          Unified Silla period, it was known as Wansanju. In the Later Three Kingdoms era,
          it became the capital of the short-lived Later Baekje kingdom (892–936 CE).

          traditional Korean hanok houses, offering a glimpse into Korea’s architectural
          heritage. Jeonju is also the birthplace of bibimbap and has been designated a
          UNESCO City of Gastronomy.
